<h1>The Best Movies According to Daniel</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>
    This movie was intriguing and phenomenal.
    Just as the "Infinity War was," Endgame was a total masterpiece.
    Bringing together all the Avengers and placing them in one scene as well as other famous marvel characters.
    I was sad when Iron man sacrificed himself to save them all from Thanos. He was one reason why I watched Avengers
</p>

<h3>Rebel Ridge</h3>
<p>
    This movie is so amazing.
    I watched it last month and I must say I had no regrets.
    One thing I respect the most about the main character is that he tried his best to resort to a peaceful approach the entire time.
    However, the antagonists wanted violence.
    I did not like how it ended though and I am hoping for a part2.

<h3>Spiderman Far From Home</h3>
<p>
    This was a true work of art.
    Bringing all spidermen actors into one movie was just mind blowing.
    I have a feeling the idea came from "Spiderman Marles Morales."
    I hope a new spiderman movie comes out soon though.
