<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a computer science major college student, pursuing a career in Game Development,
   but interested in learning different fields such as Web Development and Mobile App Development.
</p>

<p>
  Help Desk is another field, I have been working on. It has always been a passion of mine to assist people
  and enable them to figure out stuff. In this sense, having experience in common softwares that people tend
  to use, will go a long way to assisting others and not in the abscence of helping users navigate their
  operating system and some hardware aspects.
</p>

<p>I am a beginnner in web development and with time, I will expand this website as my skills develop.
  I have covered the basics of HTML, Python, Java and still learning more to improve upon my skills. With God all things are possible.
